This is Avijit. I'm a functional and reactive programing enthusiast and keen on learning new technologies with 15 years of experience. While I’m always getting better at what I do, I’ll will never get there which means there’s always more to learn. My experience has been mostly on the Java stack though I’m branching out into other technologies. Domain wise I'm most proficient in the **P&C** Insurance sphere having worked at multiple Fortune 500 enterprises over the years.

I love to mentor people into better technical skills and to coach development teams into higher productivity. Open to consulting opportunities. The [Contact](#contact) form 👇 below would be the best way to reach me if you need to.<br>

This idea of writing this technical blog came to mind during the COVID times when we were all locked up and there was plenty of time to kill. Thought this could be good place to pen down some of my tech learnings to help me keep track.
This site as I foresee it will be forever be in 🚧. And you would find 🔜 banners at some places with UpVoting options via Discord. Help me prioritize. I sincerely hope this site might help others get started in their **cloud-native** 🚀.

When I’m not at a computer or spending time with my family, I prefer to be outside. <br>
:bicyclist: is something I :heart:
